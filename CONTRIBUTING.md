# Introduction

### Welcome!

Thank you for considering contributing to Iterate for iOS. We welcome PRs and appreciate the help, we encourage you to first open an issue to confirm we aren't already working on your feature or bug and confirm it's something we'd like added to the project.

### What we're looking for

Iterate for iOS is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from the community. We're open to many contributions including features, bug fixes, documentation improvements, etc.

### The Process

1. Create an issue to make sure its something that should be done.
2. Create a fork & branch.
3. Do your work (be sure to adhere to the existing style of the project)
4. Write tests when necessary (if in doubt, add a test)
5. Create a PR to iterate-ios/master and request a review. Include as much detail as possible in the PR explaining the change and method used to implement it.
6. Make any changes in response to the review.
7. Celebrate your honorary status as a member of the team!

### Important notes

In order to support both CocoaPods and SPM, all views with custom classes in the Storyboard or Xib files should leave "Inherit Module From Target" unchecked and explicitly declare Module "Iterate".
